    "1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.copy(src, dst): This function is used to copy a single file from the source (src) to the destination (dst). It creates a new file at the destination with the same contents as the source file.\n",
    "shutil.copytree(src, dst): This function is used to copy an entire directory (folder) from the source (src) to the destination (dst). It creates a new directory at the destination and copies all the files and subdirectories from the source directory to the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What function is used to rename files?\n",
    "The shutil.move(src, dst) function is used to rename files and directories in Python. It can also be used to move files to a different location while renaming them in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "send2trash module: The send2trash module provides a cross-platform way to move files and directories to the trash or recycle bin, allowing for safe deletion with a potential option for recovery.\n",
    "shutil module: The shutil module includes functions like shutil.rmtree() to recursively delete directories and os.remove() to delete individual files. These functions permanently delete files and directories, and there is no option for recovery from the system's trash or recycle bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "The zipfile.ZipFile(filename, mode) method is equivalent to the open() method for file objects. It allows you to create or open a ZIP file (filename) with the specified mode (e.g., 'r' for reading or 'w' for writing)."
