    "1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?\n",
    "Escape characters are special characters used in strings to represent characters that are difficult to input directly, such as newline, tab, or special symbols. They are preceded by a backslash (). For example, '\\n' represents a newline character, and '\\t' represents a tab character.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "'\\n' stands for a newline character.\n",
    "'\\t' stands for a tab character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?\n",
    "To include a literal backslash character in a string, you can use a double backslash ('\\'). For example, \"This is a backslash: \\\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The string \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not escaped a problem?\n",
    "In this case, the single quote inside the string is not a problem because the string is enclosed in double quotes. You can use single quotes inside double-quoted strings without escaping them, and vice versa."
